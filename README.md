# TDWG theme

A [Pelican](http://docs.getpelican.com/) theme for the TDWG website.

## Getting started

This theme was developed for the [TDWG website](https://github.com/tdwg/website). It wouldn't make a lot of sense to use for any other website, but you're welcome to adapt it. To get started, download the theme and reference its path in your [Pelican settings](http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/settings.html#themes). For example:

```python
THEME = "../tdwg-theme" # If tdwg-theme is in the same directory as your website repo
```
